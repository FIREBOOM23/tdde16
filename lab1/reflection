The “pancakes” has the highest tf-idf score; the “you” has the lowest tf-idf score. Tf-idf depends on the frequency of the relevant words. The higher the frequency of the relevant word, the higher the tf-idf. The “tf” means the frequency of the words in the specific document, and “idf” means the frequency of the words in all documents. Therefore, the “you”, “can”, “up”, etc, which are empty words like pronouns, auxiliary words, prepositions, etc, have lower tf-idf than the content words like “pancakes”, “pile”, which are nouns.

I think the lemmatization is the most appropriate for this “search engine” example. Because lemmatization can normalize variant forms of a word into a single feature, ensure that the tf-idf weight is assigned only to the most meaningful and distinguishing terms, improving the accuracy of the search match, and finally removes numbers, symbols, and punctuation, ensuring that only true linguistic terms contribute to the document's vector representation.
